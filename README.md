# Integrated-Retail-Analytics-for-Store-Optimization
*Objective: To utilize machine learning and data analysis techniques to optimize store performance, forecast demand, and enhance customer experience through segmentation and personalized marketing strategies.*
##Project Components:
1. Anomaly Detection in Sales Data:
   * Identify unusual sales patterns across stores and departments.
   * Investigate potential causes (e.g., holidays, markdowns, economic indicators).
   * Implement anomaly handling strategies to clean the data for further analysis.
2. Time-Based Anomaly Detection: 
   *  Analyze sales trends over time.
   *  Detect seasonal variations and holiday effects on sales.
   *  Use time-series analysis for understanding store and department performance over time.
3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: 
   *  Handle missing values, especially in the MarkDown data.
   *  Create new features that could influence sales (e.g., store size/type, regional factors).
4. Customer Segmentation Analysis: 
   *  Segment stores or departments based on sales patterns, markdowns, and regional features.
   *  Analyze segment-specific trends and characteristics.
5. Market Basket Analysis: 
   *  Although individual customer transaction data is not available, infer potential product associations within departments using sales data.
   *  Develop cross-selling strategies based on these inferences.
6. Demand Forecasting: 
   *  Build models to forecast weekly sales for each store and department.
   *  Incorporate factors like CPI, unemployment rate, fuel prices, and store/dept attributes.
   *  Explore short-term and long-term forecasting models.
7. Impact of External Factors: 
   *  Examine how external factors (economic indicators, regional climate) influence sales.
   *  Incorporate these insights into the demand forecasting models.
8. Personalization Strategies: 
   *  Develop personalized marketing strategies based on the markdowns and store segments.
   *  Propose inventory management strategies tailored to store and department needs.
9. Segmentation Quality Evaluation: 
   *  Evaluate the effectiveness of the customer segmentation.
   *  Use metrics to assess the quality of segments in terms of homogeneity and separation.
10. Real-World Application and Strategy Formulation: 
   *  Formulate a comprehensive strategy for inventory management, marketing, and store optimization based on the insights gathered.
   *  Discuss potential real-world challenges in implementing these strategies.

#### EDA Using Barplot, Linechart, Violinplot, Correlation matrix.
#### Method used for Detecting Anomalies in Retail Data: Techniques like mean, median, and standard deviation can be used to calculate summary statistics, which help identify point anomalies.
#### Strategies used to mitigate the impact of anomalies without removing the data points: Data cleaning, Data normalization, Data imputation.
#### Time based Anomaly detection: 
   *  Create Rolling Statistics: Calculate rolling averages, moving sums, and standard deviations to track data variations over time.
   *  Apply Exponential Smoothing: Use exponential moving averages (EMA) and anomaly detection techniques to highlight unusual patterns in time series data.
   *  Highlight Anomalies: Set thresholds and visual cues to identify significant deviations from smoothed values, aiding in anomaly detection and trend analysis.
#### Customer Segmentation Analysis: Algorithm used for Segmentation in Retail Data applied the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment stores and departments. K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique widely used for grouping data into clusters based on similarity.
#### Metric used for Segmentation Quality Evaluation in Retail Data: silhouette score metric is used to evaluate the quality of segments (A silhouette score closer to 1 indicates better segmentation quality, and after analysis, we determined the optimal number of clusters to be 4 for both store and department segments)
#### Personalization strategies for store segment: 
   *  Cluster 0: Premium Space Retailers & Sizeable Luxury Stores
   *  Cluster 1: Value-Oriented Stores
   *  Cluster 2: Budget-Friendly Stores
   *  Cluster 3: Compact Elegance Stores
#### Personalization strategies for Department segment: 
   *  Cluster 0: Sizeable Luxury Departments
   *  Cluster 1: Premium Selection Departments
   *  Cluster 2: Elite Departments
   *  Cluster 3: Grand Outlets Department
#### Algorithms Used in Market Basket Analysis in Retail Data: The Apriori Algorithm widely uses and is well-known for Association Rule mining, making it a popular choice in market basket analysis. 
#### Models Used for Demand Forecasting in Retail Data
   *  Short-term forecasting model(SARIMA)- Predicting future events or values over a relatively brief period, often within weeks or months, for immediate operational decisions.
   *  Long-term forecasting model(Random Forest)- Predicting future trends and values over an extended period, typically spanning months to years, for strategic planning and decision-making.
   *  Forecasting using the Holt-Winters Model: 
         *  To perform forecasting using the Holt-Winters Model, also known as Triple Exponential Smoothing.
         *  We can leverage the Holt-Winters Model to perform forecasting and predict future weekly sales for each store and department, taking into account the level, trend, and seasonality components of the data.
